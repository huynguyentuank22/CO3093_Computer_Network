# Assignment 2: Network Design and Simulation for a Critical Large Hospital

This assignment is about designing a topology of a network for a critical large company 
in which different departments have some computers in different buildings and setting up 
their network so that they can interact and communicate with each other by exchanging 
data. The network is designed and simulated using a Cisco Packet Tracer (or other 
alternatives). Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT) is a multitasking network simulation software 
that can be used to perform and analyze various network activities such as the 
implementation of different topologies, selection of optimum paths based on various 
routers, and analysis of different network configurations.
